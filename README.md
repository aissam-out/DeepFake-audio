# DeepFake-audio

In this project I used Transfer Learning and some audio clips of Trump talking to create a fake interview of the ex US president.

The interview is completely made up of quotes from the popular TV show The office.

The repo contains the Notebook as well as the output audio file of the fake interview.

The code used in this project is based on the implementation of [Transfer Learning from Speaker Verification to Multispeaker Text-To-Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04558.pdf) (SV2TTS) with a vocoder that works in real-time. You can find more about this implementation in [misbah4064's repository](https://github.com/misbah4064/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning).
